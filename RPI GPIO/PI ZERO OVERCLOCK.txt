Keeping your Pi cool is key when overclocking


Basic overclock

arm_freq=1000
gpu_freq=500
core_freq=500
sdram_freq=500
sdram_schmoo=0x02000020
over_voltage=2
sdram_over_voltage=2


Advance Overclock

arm_freq=1050
gpu_freq=500
core_freq=500
sdram_freq=500
sdram_schmoo=0x02000020
over_voltage=2
sdram_over_voltage=2


after we boot back up we can see if the overclock worked

Press F4 on your keyboard while running RetroPie and type in this command

cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
